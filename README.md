# Developer DAO - User Directory

The goal of this proposal is to start the conversation about building a user directory for the Developer DAO. The community is large and Discord isn't the best solution for searching and connecting with others.

A good solution would be one that:
- Allows users to connect their wallet to the dApp and create a profile where they can signal their competencies/skills/discipline, provide contact information, location, spoken language etc.
- Provides a search or filtering mechanism so users can connect with others in the community
- Keeps statistics about the Developer DAO community to leverage in other aspects of the DAO. For example, the metrics could show companies how many people are looking for jobs, how many countries we represent or what technologies people are using.


## Demo
Here is a quick demo: https://developer-dao-profiles.vercel.app
